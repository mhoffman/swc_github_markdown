# Markdown

- a very easy to read and write markup [syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
- write once and convert to whatever your collaborator is familiar with

## Syntax

- `# Title here` for a title
- `## Section name here` for a section
- `### Subsection name here` for a subsection

## Pandoc

- great [tool](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) support for converting between **many** formats by John McFarlane

- support for HTML, LaTeX, doc(x), epub2

- good support for scientific manuscripts generated by markdown including BibTeX

    pandoc --csl=$(readlink -f ~/src/citation-styles/american-chemical-society.csl )  --bibliography my.bib -s -S manuscript.md -o manuscript.pdf

## Blogging with Jekyll

- create a GitHub repository named <username>.github.io

- inside create the following minimal directory layout

    _config.yml
    _layouts
    _data
    index.html

- the minimal _config.yml could look as follows

        source: _source
        destination: _deploy
        kramdown:
            input: GFM

- the index.html is the first landing page
- _layouts/*.html allows for separation of content from presentation
  Templates go inside _templates and can be regular HTML files.
  But they need to contain `{{ content }}` as a place holder for the main content.
  Jekyll gives you all the freedom of HTML+CSS (+JS) to use but there are many good
  starting points, e.g. https://github.com/atmos/atmos.github.io/blob/master/_layouts/default.html



- Regular pages and posts have a header section and a body section.
  A minimal header section looks like (*.md)

        ---
        layout: default
        title: foobar bla
        ---

        -> Content goes here.

- _data allows for basic database support.
  Put *.yml files in `_data`, e.g. team_members.yml

        - first_name: Joe
          last_name: Doe
        - first_name: Peter
          last_name: Pan

  Use in page like

        {% for member in site.data.team_members %}
        1. {{member.first_name}} {{member.last_name}}

        {% endfor %}


- Blog posts go into _posts.
  Name files like `2015-03-26-title-goes-here.md`.

  Create a posts overview page like (e.g. `posts/index.md`)

        ---
        layout: default
        title: posts
        ---

        # Random Stuff I Wrote

        ---

        {% for post in site.posts %}
        {{ post.date | date_to_string }}

        {{ post.content }}
        ---
        {% endfor %}
